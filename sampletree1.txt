Making huffman tree!
Original list of individual Huffman trees (str):
HuffmanTree('b',2,None,None,None)
HuffmanTree('a',1,None,None,None)

Merging trees to make a complete Huffman Tree:
Merging tree HuffmanTree('a',1,None,None,None) and HuffmanTree('b',2,None,None,None) to make HuffmanTree('ab',3,HuffmanTree('a',1,None,None,False),HuffmanTree('b',2,None,None,True),None)
Merging done!
Final tree
HuffmanTree('ab',3,HuffmanTree('a',1,None,None,False),HuffmanTree('b',2,None,None,True),None)

Created huffman tree:
      -1-> ('b',2)
 -->
      -0-> ('a',1)

Original text was 3 characters in length which, with 1 byte per character, would be 3 ASCII bytes!
The encoding table is:
'a':0
'b':1
New text is 3 bits in length, which is 1 bytes! (Plus we'd also have to store the decoding table as well.)
That is 33.33% of the size
Program completed successfully!
